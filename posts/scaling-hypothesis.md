The Scaling Hypothesis suggests that artificial intelligence is a question primarily of vastly scaling our existing architectures. By applying our traditional learning algorithms at a vast scale we will reach increasingly sophisticated neural networks that evolve complex behaviour naturally.

The Scaling Hypothesis directly contradcits what some argue; that advanced intelligence might need innovative architectures or advanced optimization processes rather than simple units combined with vast amounts of compute. 

OpenAI's GPT-3 offers compelling evidence supporting the hypothesis. With minimal alterations from its predecessors, GPT-2 and GPT-1, scaling the model led to a generalized solution that outperforms many specialized models. Similar trends are also observable in reinforcement learning studies with large, open-ended domains showing better performance.

Despite intensive debate, proponents suggest further scaling as a path to AGI. But, the prospect of creating intelligence without equivalent wisdom is a worrying aspect of the hypothesis. This suggests that organizations with substantial resources could achieve AGI more readily than those proficient in AI alignment, potentially leading to AGI without alignment safeguards.

As these models scale and become complex, our comprehension diminishes. This could create problems, as unregulated training could lead to dangerous capabilities. Hence, some in AI safety are exploring the requirement of architectural breakthroughs for advanced AI to ensure safety.

In the face of the complexities of the Scaling Hypothesis, the potential difference between scaling data and computation might pose limitations. Data availability, in particular, could emerge as a potential bottleneckâ€”shaping the future implications of the Scaling Hypothesis.
