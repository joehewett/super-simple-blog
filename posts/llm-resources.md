### Notes
These are entry level, not-very-technical resources. Generally ranked in order of importance. I will update this list as I find new resources.

Note that these are not technical resources. I personally don't think it is important for everyone to have a deep mechanistic understanding of how LLMs work, but I do think it is important to have a high level understanding of the theory and conversations taking place around the LLMs. This is what this list is for.

# Important individual blog posts to read
1. [The Bitter Lesson](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html) - Rich Sutton - a seminal piece on the history of AI and always worth a read.
2. [Simulators](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/vJFdjigzmcXMhNTsx/simulators) - Janus - more LLM specific, this post gives a framework for thinking about how LLMs interface with reality. I think the Simulator ontology gives a solid foundation for further reasoning about LLMs, even if it is a bit esoteric.
3. [A Mechanistiic Interpretability Analysis of Grokking](https://twitter.com/NeelNanda5/status/1559060507524403200) - Neel Nanda - MI is a complex field of study and very new, so it's perhaps quite opaque to a new non-technical user. But I've linked a tweet thread here which gives you a good gist of an import paper. It's a paper that tells us that we can look inside models and figure out what they're doing. We're in the very early days of this, but you'll no doubt hear more about MI in the future. You can dig into the more formal writeups if you want. 
4. [Why AI Will Save The World](https://pmarca.substack.com/p/why-ai-will-save-the-world) - Marc Andreessen - a techno-optimist, Marc delivers the other perspective on AI being solely a force for good with very little concern for unintended consequences. I don't agree with all of Marc's takes, and some of the voices in the e/acc movement in general are of poor quality, but Marc is a unique orator and I think it's important to give all perspectives a fair hearing.
