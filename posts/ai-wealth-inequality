# AI & Inequality
Concise thoughts on the relationship between AI and income inequality.

## Artificial Intelligence will help elevate people out of poverty

Technology has significantly improved human living standards. This is is noticeable when considering the increase in the poverty threshold due to technological advancements. The GDP witnessed [a 500% increase](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-gdp-over-the-last-two-millennia?stackMode=relative&time=earliest..2015) from 1 AD to the advent of the Industrial Revolution, followed by a dramatic 57,000% increase over the subsequent 200 years from 1800-2015.

**Applications of AI in improving human development index (HDI)**

- In healthcare, AI is instrumental in aiding discoveries and revolutionizing disease prediction [source](https://www.nber.org/papers/w24541), [source](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01798-4).
- Applications of AI technology in agriculture can significantly improve income [source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S258972172030012X).
- In education, AI can improve access and efficacy [source](http://oro.open.ac.uk/50104/1/Luckin%20et%20al.%20-%202016%20-%20Intelligence%20Unleashed.%20An%20argument%20for%20AI%20in%20Educ.pdf).

## The potential of AI to exacerbate income inequality

While it seems plausible for AI to cause massive job losses, evidence suggests that AI will more likely aid humans by increasing productivity and filling in gaps in our capabilities. Examples include providing highly skilled jobs like data science and machine learning, increasing demand for digital skills, and changing the nature of jobs to make them more technically demanding [source](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/14/6531.full.pdf), [source](https://www.un.org/pt/desa/will-robots-and-ai-cause-mass-unemployment-not-necessarily-they-do-bring-other), [source](https://www.bruegel.org/2020/06/artificial-intelligences-great-impact-on-low-and-middle-skilled-jobs/#:~:text=Artificial%20intelligence%20and%20machine%20learning,affected%20by%20past%20technological%20change.&text=Artificial%20intelligence%20(AI)%20systems%20are,of%20automation%20on%20the%20workforce).

However, algorithmic bias and continued inequality resulting from algorithmic decisions are genuine concerns [source](https://hbr.org/2020/10/algorithms-are-making-economic-inequality-worse).

## Inequality: A Problem in and of itself

Despite increases in wealth, inequality can destabilize the economy [source](https://cpag.org.uk/sites/default/files/CPAG-Poverty142-inequality-instability.pdf) and potentially give rise to catastrophic events such as warfare, plague, state collapse, or revolutions [source](https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/09/10/can-inequality-only-be-fixed-by-war-revolution-or-plague). Rising income inequality makes socio-economic mobility more challenging [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_economic_inequality#cite_note-7) and is linked to negative social phenomena such as depression, conspiracies, anti-immigrant sentiment, and rise of intolerant populism.

## Potential Solutions to AI-induced income inequality

Potential solutions to counter growing income inequality caused by AI are:

- Establishing retraining programs for displaced workers.
- Improving welfare programs to support those most affected.
- Overhauling education systems to better prepare future generations for an AI-dominated era.
- Improving democracy to ensure fair distribution of AI's benefits [source](http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/816281518818814423/2019-WDR-Report.pdf).
