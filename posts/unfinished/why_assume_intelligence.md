In this essay I assume intelligence will continue to increase. Why?

Those with a modicum of [situational awareness](https://situational-awareness.ai/) will have noticed that the Scaling Laws seem to be holding, the clusters seem to be getting bigger, the models keep getting better and the benchmarks are collapsing. 

The largest company on the planet (ticker NVDA) specialises in matrix multiplication used to locate thinking entities in the combinatorial backrooms of parameter space. Nvidia's market value as of June 2024 is close to that of the entire GDP of Germany, and about 3% of the global stock market. In theory, this is because what they are providing is valuable to companies like Meta, Google and Microsoft who are racing to bring increasingly more intelligent machines into reality. 

People make claims that deep learning is running out of steam but that doesn't appear to be the case. Issues like the data wall, information theoretic limits of current data supplies and the limits of transformers will surely be sidestepped given the absurd value latent in the generalist machine intelligence. 

Given Nvidia's ability to print money, monst of which comes from a handful of companies building their own models, we can venture to presume that large companies have thought about all of the potential bottlenecks, and have concluded that the investment is worth while. They surely believe there is a lot of value in being the creator of the thinking machines, and that there is a good amount of headroom to go in terms of the upper limits of intelligence.
