I don't have much context on the bygone eras of starting companies, but I'd wager that today is as strange a time as any to be building a technology startup. 

We stand here on the dawn of a new age of escaped genies destined (absent defeaters) to never return to their lamp. And the genies are becoming more powerful on a daily basis. In this world, what can a startup founder be certain of beyond the graphs going up and to the right?

There's a sentiment in startup circles that one should be building with an understanding that we might be at the base of an exponential, or at least a sigmoid with a lot of juice left in the tank. That's all well and good, but what does it mean for our budding biologically-based entrepreneur embarking on their journey? 

I'll report back when I find out.
