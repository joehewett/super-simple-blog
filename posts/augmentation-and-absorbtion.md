We stand here on the dawn of a new age of escaped genies destined (absent defeaters) to never return to their lamp. And the genies are becoming more powerful on a daily basis. In this world, what can a startup founder be certain of beyond the graphs going up and to the right?

There's a sentiment in startup circles that one should be building with an understanding that we might be at the base of an exponential, or at least a sigmoid with a lot of juice left in the tank. That's all well and good, but what does it mean for our budding biologically-based entrepreneur embarking on their journey? 

# Assume intelligence

Those with a modicum of [situational awareness](https://situational-awareness.ai/) will have noticed that the Scaling Laws seem to be holding, the clusters seem to be getting bigger, the models keep getting better and the benchmarks are collapsing. 

The largest company on the planet (ticker NVDA) specialises in matrix multiplication used to locate thinking entities in the combinatorial backrooms of parameter space. Nvidia's market value as of June 2024 is close to that of the entire GDP of Germany, and about 3% of the global stock market. In theory, this is because what they are providing is valuable to companies like Meta, Google and Microsoft who are racing to bring increasingly more intelligent machines into reality. 

People make claims that deep learning is running out of steam but that doesn't appear to be the case. Issues like the data wall, information theoretic limits of current data supplies and the limits of transformers will surely be sidestepped given the absurd value latent in the generalist machine intelligence. 

Given Nvidia's ability to print money, monst of which comes from a handful of companies building their own models, we can venture to presume that large companies have thought about all of the potential bottlenecks, and have concluded that the investment is worth while. They surely believe there is a lot of value in being the creator of the thinking machines, and that there is a good amount of headroom to go in terms of the upper limits of intelligence.

Those who are not Meta, Google and Microsoft would be wise to also be aware of this. 

# Practicalities of the future

What are the practical implications of living at the base of a graph going up and to the right? First and foremost, we need to create with the understanding that our creation will either be absorbed into the model or amplified by it.

We should assume given the progress, trend lines, and vested interest of the large corporations, that:
- full multi-modality across text, images, video, sound and actions will be come standard 
- future models will be capable of planning and solving long horizon, complex tasks
- creativity and ability to solve novel, unseen problems will improve, so that AI can invent new things and solve new tasks
- autonoous agents will be released on to the internet and run indefinitely in pursuit of some objective, rather than acting like chatbots that terminate at the end of a number of tokens
- a non-trivial proportion of internet traffic will be autonomous agents performing their duties 
- navigating the internet and other systems (e.g. Operating Systems, applications) will have first-class support in future models. 

The world of next token has already begun to change some areas like graphic design, copywriting, and customer service. Some of the elements of these jobs have started to be absorbed. One survey [suggests](https://www.resumebuilder.com/1-in-3-companies-will-replace-employees-with-ai-in-2024/) replaced someone with AI in 2024. 

This is not to say the jobs no longer exist, but the role of the human is transforming, for example by turning the human into a supervisor and quality assurance officer of a machine who produces the output, rather than the entity who produces the output themselves.

We'd be wise to observe the shift taking place with todays jobs in the presence of basic AI systems, and think about what might happen in a world where half of the items in the bullet point list above come to fruition. The overhang of capabilities even of the models of today is substantial. So much raw possibility lies within GPT-4o that has not yet been exploited, that we could pause for a decade and still not have automated every job that could theoritically be done in large part by AI.  

But the labs haven't downed tools. They're working as hard as they possibly can on the next breakthroughs, throwing billions of dollars at the greatest minds and machines, and they are not slowing down 

# Conclusion
Just a few years ago, discussing the possibility of AGI was enough to be branded as a crack pot, but it's now the mission statement of serious companies and the table talk of serious thinkers who don't know what Less Wrong is. They might be wrong, but how do we stay above water if they're right?
