I have only included talks from summer 2023 onwards. 

### "LLMs are stochastic parrots" and Other Bad Takes 2023-11-24 
A tech talk on common misconceptions in the LLM discourse that I think are low resolution and not productive. Specifically, addresses the claims that:
- LLMs are stochastic parrots. 
  - This argument appears reasonable on first glance but fails to account for surprising LM behaviours like the grokking of complex abilities
- LLMs can't do $task
  - Often tasks are found that LLMs are seemingly unable to solve, and these are used as proof that the LLMs is incapable of some behaviour or skill. 
  - However, often it is the case that a simple change in prompt elicits the desired behaviour
  - An example is Chain of Thought prompting being used to elicit better reasoning abilities from models 
- LLMs will never do $task
  - Often an argument is made that some task is out of the reaches of AI models
  - These arguments have been made about chess, comprehension, language in general, the ability to generalise out of distribution, etc. 
  - Advances in architectures usually solve the unsolveable problems
  - It may be the case that problems are unsolveable with current architectures, but betting against some AI system or another solving a given problem or exhibiting some behaviour seems like a bad bet. 

### Imperial College London 2023-10-25
Key points
- Discussed the state of cybersecurity, specifically anti-fraud efforts in 2023
- Spoke on the coming problem of LLM-powered fraud that we may face
- Spoke on measures we take to pre-empt this type of fraud
- Discussed operating such a system at scale and the engineering challenges we face

### GCHQ's Cyberfirst Academy 2023-08-18
Key points
- Explored the problem space of conversational scams
- Discussed a novel approach to combatting cybercrime using language models 

### KCL Tech Cybersecurity Panel 2023-10-07
Key points:
- Spoke on the arms race dynamics of cybercrime and cybercrime disruption 
- Tried to give students concrete steps to begin working in cybercrime if they have no experience; 
  - Discussed building simple toy projects to learn fundamental skills like web development and networking
  - Discussed the interview process that a new engineer might expect joining a new companny
Overall the panel was enjoyable and the audience seemed receptive to hearing some practical advice - a rarity in an academic environment.
